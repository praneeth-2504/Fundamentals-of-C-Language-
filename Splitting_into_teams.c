During the weekend, Ross Geller has decided to conduct some team games. He wants to split his friends into equal-sized teams. In some cases, some friends may be left out of the teams, and he wanted to use the left-out friends to assist him in conducting the team games.

/*
This C program calculates the number of friends in each team and the number of friends left out when dividing a given number of friends into a certain number of teams. It reads the number of friends and the number of teams as input from the user using `scanf()`. Then, it calculates the number of friends in each team by dividing the total number of friends by the number of teams. Additionally, it computes the number of friends left out by finding the remainder of the division. Finally, it prints the number of friends in each team and the number left out using `printf()`, formatted as specified, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
